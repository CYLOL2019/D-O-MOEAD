function obj = subobjective(weight, ind, idealpoint, method)
%SUBOBJECTIVE function evaluate a point's objective with a given method of
%decomposition. 

%   Two method are implemented by far is Weighted-Sum and Tchebesheff.
%   weight: is the decomposition weight.(column wise vector).
%   ind: is the individual point(column wise vector).
%   idealpoint: the idealpoint for Tchebesheff decomposition.
%   method: is the decomposition method, the default is 'te' when is
%   omitted.
%   
%   weight and ind can also be matrix. in which have two scenairos:
%   When weight is a matrix, then it's treated as a column wise set of
%   weights. in that case, if ind is a size 1 column vector, then the
%   subobjective is computed with every weight and the ind; if ind is also
%   a matrix of the same size as weight, then the subobjective is computed
%   in a column-to-column, with each column of weight computed against the
%   corresponding column of ind. 
%   A row vector of subobjective is return in both case.
