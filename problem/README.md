# Problem
This document includes the data of the instance, which is named port20 and involves 225 assets.

In portfolio problem, there are two txt files. port20.txt is the input data of port20 and portef20.txt is the data about uncontrained Pareto front. 
By the way, a comprehensive instance repository can be found at https://github.com/CYLOL2019/Portfolio-Instances.

In gamsdata, these txt files are converted from port20.txt. Because they are used as the input data for GAMS, hence, the format of them should be adjusted from the original one.
